# SPA-avoid-reloading
An exercise with a single page application where it doesn't reload the page with every time

## Description
In this program I have a page with lots of information, and instead of the page reloading and putting the new information on the page, it loads it all but scrolls into view when it is requested to go to that page.

## Improvements
Adjusting the navagation bar for better style and efficiency.
